To celebrate the close of Microsoft Build and Spring exams coming to an end, Reactor London is thrilled to invite students from London and across the UK to Microsoft Build: Student Developer Drop-in Day.

This Open House is a drop-in event - come along to the bits which are most relevant to you!

Check out all of the Microsoft Learn [paths and resources](http://aka.ms/learnstudent).

## AI Gaming 
Write code to play the Microsoft Match Game. Our version of the popular card game where you have to find two cards with the same image to make a match. But in our Game, no two tiles are the same. You have to match up the tiles that contain the same subject matter using the A.I. power of Azure Cognitive Services to analyse the images on each tile and to determine what subject of each image is. You start with a set of tiles face down and you get to turn over two tiles at a time in order to match tiles in pairs, but, unlike the usual version of the matching game, you are not looking for two identical images. You have to use Microsoftâ€™s Cognitive Services to understand exactly what the content of each tile image is. Then you need to find another tile with the same content. Interested in taking part watch he following introduction [Video](https://youtu.be/Z0oWM6RiFx8) read the game [instructions](https://github.com/microsoft/AcademicContent/blob/main/microsoft-conferences/2022/Microsoft-Build-Student-Developer-Drop-in-day/aigaming-matchgame.md) and join the [AI Gaming Challenge Commpetition Closes 28th May 2022](https://www.aigaming.com/event?code=232-619-896)
